          My research approach placed a strong emphasis in understanding the existing platforms and 
          how they are solving for creating a component set. it was discovered that they had very little 
          feedback in case of both positive and negative aspects.
          <br/><br/>
          Even though their wider audience was happy it was identified that creating something that involves 
          the best functionality of all three components could solve the objective that was initially developed.

          Upon conducting heuristics it was discovered that there could be many things that 
          could be used for creating a plugin that can reduce human efforts like, a preview option in 
          Design system generator, styles to explore with a certain theme. and finally figuring out how to document it.
          <br/><br/>
          It was discovered that other plugins were just creating a component set but not generating 
          document in order to kick start a project.

          After understanding the how might we questions it became clear to distinguish the features that might be most required vs least required when creating the plugin design. 
          <br/><br/>
          This also later helped in creating the visual hierarchy of the components displayed when creating the plugin.

          <b style={{fontWeight:"500", marginBottom:"0.5rem"}}>[Approach 2] </b>
          The decision work as per trial and error method was taken as we did not have much data in terms 
          of how the users would feel when using the newly developed iteration.
          <br/><br/>
          Hence usability test was conducted with 3 participants in order to understand if the target was met. 
          This also needed the design to be developed asap.

              For instance, right now bringing new button designs to the plugin is what I&apos;m trying to pull of in such a way that 
              I can also develop a code for it as well. Next is finding time to test the design one more time.
